# Design Teardown (with Smashing Magazine)

A project to think about what makes a good design work. A gray-scale heat map of [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. Using different font styles and weights and see how that affects the visual feel of the page. It's a chance to think about what makes good design and to start thinking about the user experience.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown) for more information.
